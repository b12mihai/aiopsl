- Added a new  application {aiopls}\build\aiop_t4ls_sim\tests\arena_test.
   It contains slab  functionality (slab create in init pahase and  slab aquire in run-time and slab release)
   malloc() from the heap and xmalloc() from  DP-DDR, SHARED RAM and PEB memory partitions in init and ruin-time phase.
