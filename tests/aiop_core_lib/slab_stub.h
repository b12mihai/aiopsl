 @Function      slab_find_and_reserve_bpid

 @Description   Finds and reserve buffer pool with new buffers

                This function is part of SLAB module therefore it should be called only after
                it has been initialized by slab_module_init()

 @Param[in]     num_buffs           Number of buffers in new pool.
 @Param[in]     buff_size           Size of buffers in pool.
 @Param[in]     alignment           Requested alignment for data field (in bytes).
                                    AIOP: HW pool supports up to 8 bytes alignment.
 @Param[in]     mem_partition_id    Memory partition ID for allocation.
                                    AIOP: HW pool supports only PEB and DPAA DDR.
 @Param[out]    num_filled_buffs    Number of buffers that we succeeded to fill.
 @Param[out]    bpid                Id if the buffer that was filled with new buffers.

 @Return        0       - on success,
               -ENAVAIL - could not release into bpid
               -ENOMEM  - not enough memory for mem_partition_id
